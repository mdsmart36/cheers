For example, if name is "Bob", output should be:

```shell
Give me a.. b
Give me an.. o
Give me a.. b
BOB is.. GRAND!
```

## Cheers (Part 2)

### What to Implement
1. After your user enters their name, your program should ask for their birthdate.
2. After the cheer, your program should tell the user how many more days there are until their next birthday.
  - The user should only have to under the Day and Month

THe final version of your app should work like the following:


```shell
What's your name?
> Bob
What's your birthday?
> 10/19

Give me a.. b
Give me an.. o
Give me a.. b
BOB is.. GRAND!

Your today is _____ days away!
```

If the person's birthday is that day your program should say:

```shell
Happy Birthday!!
```
